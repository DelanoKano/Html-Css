                <h1 id="title1">ORIGINS OF NISSAN</h1>
                <p id="text1">The name Nissan originated in Japan, when founder Yoshisuke Aikawa became president of
                    Nihon Sangyo in 1928. Primarily dealing in foundries and auto parts, Nihon Sangyo debuted on the
                    Tokyo Stock Exchange by its ticker name NISSAN in 1933. Nissan expanded beyond its Japanese roots
                    from there, and officially came to the U.S. as Datsun in 1958.</p>

                <h1 id="title2">Nissan Skyline</h1>
                <p id="text2">The Nissan Skyline is the predecessor to the revolutionary Nissan GT-R®, the Skyline was
                    first introduced in 1957. The rear-wheel drive coupe has never been commercially available in
                    America, but it has always been a highly sought-after import. The modern Nissan R35 GT-R was
                    introduced to the world, and made for sale in the United States, in 2009.</p>

                <h1 id="title3">1990-1999: A DECADE OF AGILITY</h1>
                <p id="text3">Nissan demonstrates its agility by retaining the Nissan heritage while moving in new
                    directions.
                    In 1991, Nissan receives its first environmental award from the EPA, and takes a big leap forward in
                    green technology by lending its Alternative Fuel Vehicle to a California testing program and
                    introducing the Future Electric Vehicle concept car. In 1997, Nissan is named “Best of the Best” by
                    the Environmental Protection Agency, and Nissan Smyrna is lauded as the most productive plant in
                    North America in "The Harbour Report” for a fourth consecutive year. In 1992, 1 Millon Maxima's were
                    sold.</p>

                <p id="text4">Nissan helped to lead the automotive industry into the age of electric vehicles when it
                    debuted the all-electric Nissan LEAF® and throughout the decade continues its tradition of
                    innovation that excites with all new vehicles like the Nissan Kicks and safety technology like its
